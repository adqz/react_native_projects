----------Naming conventions----------
1. Fat arrow functions: Camel case, initial is capital
2. Variables: camel case, initial is small
3. .js files: camel case, initial is capital
4. Component names: same as .js files coz they share same name


----------App.js----------

1. We write jsx in react which is then converted to javascript by this thing called "babel" which is a javascript compiler running in the react-native bundler
2. "createStackNavigator" is an object which stores what content will be shown on the screen at any given point in time
3. 



--------ComponentsScreen.js------------

1. "StyleSheet.create" validates the properties so we get better error messages if we misspell any property (eg - fontsize instead of fontSize)
