----------Naming conventions----------
1. Fat arrow functions: Camel case, initial is capital
2. Variables: camel case, initial is small
3. .js files: camel case, initial is capital
4. Component names: same as .js files coz they share same name


----------App.js----------

1. We write jsx in react which is then converted to javascript by this thing called "babel" which is a javascript compiler running in the react-native bundler
2. "createStackNavigator" is an object which stores what content will be shown on the screen at any given point in time
3. 



--------ComponentsScreen.js------------

1. "StyleSheet.create" validates the properties so we get better error messages if we misspell any property (eg - fontsize instead of fontSize)


----------CounterScreen.js----------
1. 'useState()' function needs to be used to initialize a variable as a state
2. A state's value can't be changed directly. Its respective function needs to be used to update it. For example - 

const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0); //initialize with default value of 0
setCounter(counter+1) //to increase value of counter by 1

Cannot do this:  counter = counter + 1;

3. When state value is changed, the whole component get re-rendered. Also, all children of the component get re-rendered too.


----------ColorScreen.js----------
1. Use back ticks for string formatting. For eg - 
A = 234.134;
B = 252.345;

ans = `${A} + ${B} = ${A+B}` // these are backpacks, not single quotes
